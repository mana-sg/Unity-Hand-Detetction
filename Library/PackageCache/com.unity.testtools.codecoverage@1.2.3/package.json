This allows specifying an external Json file which contains path and assembly filtering rules. When this file contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories.\n<br/>**Note:** The `pathFiltersFromFile` option will be deprecated in the next package major release. Please use the new `filtersFromFile` option instead.\n- Make sure `--burst-disable-compilation` is [expected](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/getting-started.html#command-line-options) to be passed with two dashes, unlike other editor command line options."
