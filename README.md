# Unity-Hand-Detetction
A simple computer vision code using openCV and CVzone to detect your hand and give it landmarks. 
These landmarks are then transferred to a C# code in Unity which uses the landmarks to initialise spheres at the locations to look like a hand. 
Maximum hands at once is 1. 

Usage:
Open the project folder in unity.
Run the python script in terminal.
Go to unity and check if 21 spheres are created and have C# script to it.
Run the unity project, it will track your hand if it is in the unity project.
